## What is Blitzy Public Samples?

**Blitzy Public Samples** is a curated collection of production-grade repositories generated by Blitzy's autonomous development platform. Each project is a real-world demonstration of what Blitzy produces end-to-end so you can evaluate output quality before committing to anything.

---

## Why Public Samples?

Evaluating an AI development platform shouldn't require a leap of faith. Public Samples gives you the evidence to make an informed decision:

- **See the output quality firsthand** — review generated code, tests, and documentation
- **Understand the process** — trace each project from prompt to pull request
- **Benchmark against your stack** — find samples relevant to your language, framework, or migration target
- **Validate the 80/20 claim** — see exactly what Blitzy automates and what it leaves for your engineers

---

## The Blitzy Philosophy

Blitzy automates **80% of development work** through AI agents, leaving the critical **20%** for human expertise. Every repository in Public Samples is evidence of this principle in action:

- **System 2 Thinking**: AI agents that reason for hours, not seconds — producing architecturally sound, maintainable code
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Thousands of specialized agents working in concert across your entire codebase
- **Runtime Validation**: All generated code is compiled and tested before delivery
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Strategic oversight preserved at key decision points

## Getting Started

### For Developers & Evaluators

No account required — start exploring immediately:

1. **Browse the Samples**
   - Filter repositories by language, framework, or use case
   - Review the lifecycle stage to understand where each project stands
   - Download artifacts including Tech Specs and Architect Action Plans

2. **Inspect the Output**
   - Review commits and pull requests to see exactly what Blitzy generated
   - Clone locally and run the build to validate functionality
   - Compare generated code against your own quality standards

3. **Trace the Process**
   - Review the original prompt that initiated each project
   - Walk through the Tech Spec and AAP to understand agent reasoning
   - See how Blitzy handles edge cases, tests, and documentation automatically

## Key Concepts

### The 80/20 Principle
Blitzy autonomously generates **up to 80%** of your codebase, handling:
- Business logic and application structure
- Boilerplate and repetitive patterns
- Standard CRUD operations and API integrations
- Database schemas and migrations
- Component structures and UI scaffolding
- Test suites and coverage
- Inline documentation and README generation

The critical **20%** — edge cases, performance optimizations, and domain-specific decisions — stays with your engineers.

### System 2 AI Thinking
Unlike copilot-style tools that respond in seconds, Blitzy agents engage in **extended reasoning**:
- Hours of computation for architecturally complex problems
- Multi-agent collaboration with cross-validation
- Iterative refinement cycles before any code is delivered
- Compile-time and runtime verification baked in

### Tech Spec as Foundation
Every Blitzy project begins with an automatically generated Technical Specification:
- Complete codebase documentation
- Dependency mapping and architecture diagrams
- API contracts and data models

The Tech Spec stays **synchronized with your code** throughout the project lifecycle so your documentation never drifts.
